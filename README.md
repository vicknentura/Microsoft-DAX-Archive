Common Expressions for Excel and Query Language for PowerQuery or PowerBI

## Aggregation Functions
* Aggregation functions calculate a (scalar) value such as count, sum, average, minimum, or maximum for all rows in a column or table as defined by the expression.*

## Date and Time Functions
*These functions help you create calculations based on dates and time. Many of the functions in DAX are similar to the Excel date and time functions. However, DAX functions use a datetime data type, and can take values from a column as an argument.*

## Filter Functions
*The filter and value functions in DAX are some of the most complex and powerful, and differ greatly from Excel functions. The lookup functions work by using tables and relationships, like a database. The filtering functions let you manipulate data context to create dynamic calculations.*

## Financial Functions
*Financial functions in DAX are used in formulas that perform financial calculations, such as net present value and rate of return. These functions are similar to financial functions used in Microsoft Excel.*

## Information Functions
*DAX information functions look at the cell or row that is provided as an argument and tells you whether the value matches the expected type. For example, the ISERROR function returns TRUE if the value that you reference contains an error.*

## Logical Functions
*Logical functions act upon an expression to return information about the values or sets in the expression. For example, you can use the IF function to check the result of an expression and create conditional results.*

## Math and Trig Functions
*The mathematical functions in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) are very similar to the Excel mathematical and trigonometric functions. This section lists the mathematical functions provided by DAX.*

## Other Functions
*These functions perform unique actions that cannot be defined by any of the categories.*

## Parent and Child Functions
*These functions manage data that is presented as parent/child hierarchies. To learn more, see [Understanding functions for Parent-Child Hierarchies in DAX]([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/understanding-functions-for-parent-child-hierarchies-in-dax]).*

## Relationship Functions
*Functions in this category are for managing and utilizing relationships between tables.*

## Statistical Functions
*Statistical functions calculate values related to statistical distributions and probability, such as standard deviation and number of permutations.*

## Table Manipulation Functions
*These functions return a table or manipulate existing tables.*

## Text Functions
*Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) includes a set of text functions based on the library of string functions in Excel, but which have been modified to work with tables and columns in tabular models. This section describes text functions available in the DAX language.*

## Time Intelligence Functions
*Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) includes time-intelligence functions that enable you to manipulate data using time periods, including days, months, quarters, and years, and then build and compare calculations over those periods. Before using any time-intelligence functions, make sure to mark one of the tables containing date column as Date Table.*
