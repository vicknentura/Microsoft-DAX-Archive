ROLLUP	
Modifies the behavior of SUMMARIZE by adding rollup rows to the result on columns defined by the groupBy_columnName parameter.

ROLLUPADDISSUBTOTAL	
Modifies the behavior of SUMMARIZECOLUMNS by adding rollup/subtotal rows to the result based on the groupBy_columnName columns.

ROLLUPISSUBTOTAL	
Pairs rollup groups with the column added by ROLLUPADDISSUBTOTAL within an ADDMISSINGITEMS expression.

ROLLUPGROUP	
Modifies the behavior of SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS by adding rollup rows to the result on columns defined by the the groupBy_columnName parameter.

ROW	
Returns a table with a single row containing values that result from the expressions given to each column.

SELECTCOLUMNS	
Adds calculated columns to the given table or table expression.

SUBSTITUTEWITHINDEX	
Returns a table which represents a left semijoin of the two tables supplied as arguments.

SUMMARIZE	
Returns a summary table for the requested totals over a set of groups.

SUMMARIZECOLUMNS	
Returns a summary table over a set of groups.

Table Constructor	
Returns a table of one or more columns.

TOPN
